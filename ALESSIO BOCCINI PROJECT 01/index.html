            <h3>Some History</h3>
            <p>John Galliano was born in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar on November 28, 1960.
               At age six moved with his family to south London, where he was educated. At age 16 he left Wilson’s Grammar School for Boys, where he had been an undistinguished student, to study textile design at East London College. 
               In 1980 he entered St. Martin’s School of Art, London, where he became enamoured of historical costuming. 
               His 1984 graduate collection, Les Incroyables, inspired by the French Revolution, was purchased straight off the college’s catwalk by the owner of an exclusive London fashion boutique. 
               Galliano was appointed head designer of Givenchy in 1995, becoming the first British designer to head a French haute couture house. 
               After two years, he moved to Christian Dior. Galliano created some of the industry's most famous collections, including the Blanche Dubois in October 2008 (inspired by the 1951 film A Streetcar Named Desire), 
               the Napoleon and Josephine in March 1992 (inspired by the love story of these famous historic figures) and the Princess Lucretia in October 1993 (inspired by the Russian princess). 
               Beyond the clothing donned by his models, Galliano is known for his own dramatic final-bow-costumes, finishing his shows wearing fantastical get-ups inspired by the likes of Napoleon Bonaparte and U.S. astronauts. Since 2014 he is the creative director at Maison Margiela.
